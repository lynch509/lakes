				The answer is yes you can, right over lake Huron in one of the largest interactive models of the Great Lakes anywhere in the world. 
				The physical bodies of water and the regional flora and fauna that populate the Great Lakes Basin are featured in this experience. In addition to the rainstorm, you can also help the fog roll in over Lake Superior and navigate the Soo Locks. </p>
